# Nitey Code of Conduct 1.0
By participating in this repository, you agree to not act like an annoying, pretentious child.
If you can manage that, chances are you do not need to read the rest of this.

## For everyone else
### Acceptable behavior
* Using welcoming, inclusive language
* Showing empathy towards others
* Accepting constructive criticism
* Respecting differing viewpoints
### Unacceptable behavior
* The screaming in public restrooms prank
* Being intentionally unhelpful or misleading
* Offensive, derogatory or insulting comments
* Publishing private information without permission

If you are told to stop by a repository maintainer for any reason, you MUST comply immediately.

### Consequences
Misconduct may result in removal of your contributions and restrictions on further participation.

## That sounds silly
You can fork the repository if you disagree with these terms, assuming
the license allows you to, if there is one; otherwise you cannot.
But come on. Just use some common sense please.

And yes, the repository maintainers are expected to follow these terms as well.
